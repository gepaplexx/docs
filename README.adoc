= docs

== intro
We want to write once, publish anywhere! +
Git is the single source of truth.

== our goal
we want to preserve the information that we create while engineering. +
this needs to be easy.

=== with asciidoc we can:

 * write docs in virtually any IDE or editor we use
 * store the docs with any sourcecode we produce and in any repo we use
 * use ci/cd to publish to a gitlab/hub page
 * combine the docs from individual repos to one central document
 
=== example on gitlab:
https://gitlab.com/gepaplexx/gp-documentation-example
https://gepaplexx.gitlab.io/gp-documentation-example/

=== current main document:
https://gepaplexx.gitlab.io/gp-openshift/
